Sufia-based repository for CBRC data

This is the code for a Sufia-based repository (see https://github.com/projecthydra/sufia) of data for the Center for Biological Research Collections at Indiana University.

Note that this repository contains only the files that are altered from an out-of-box-install of Sufia. To use, create a Sufia repository using the instructions provided there, then overwrite the code here on top.
